# programming-project-2-cards-against-life-groep-iv

This is a cards game made with Unity. We will use a php server for authentication and a node.js server to host our own API.

We have split our logic and branches in 3. The main is for the game, nodeJSAPI is for our API and php is for our php server.


## Testing
We have created a test user with the username: cardwizard and password: 12345678.

## Credits
Ryan, Anton, Sara and Alvaro have worked on this project.

Ryan was responsible for the php server and the API.

Anton, Sara, Alvar worked on the game itself.
