# programming-project-2-cards-against-life-groep-iv

This is a cards game made with Unity. We will use a php server for authentication and a node.js server to host our own API communication with a running mysql database.

We have split our logic and branches in 3. The main is for the game, nodeJSAPI is for our API and php is for our php server.

## Collaborate
We had some initial merge problems that we could not work out so we changed over to the build Unity versioning control feature 'collaborate'.
This worked great for us. It synct everyone up with the same project but this also means that the code each indivdual has pushed to git not completely translate in what each person has made. The code each one wrote will be more clear in our demo vide.


## Testing the Game
THe .exe is located under 
 
We have created a test user with the username: cardwizard and password: 12345678.
